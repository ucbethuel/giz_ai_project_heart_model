# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze heart health data and predict the presence of heart disease. It is designed as a simple yet effective example of how healthcare data can be leveraged to build predictive models for early diagnosis.

## Project Overview

Heart disease remains a leading cause of death worldwide. Early prediction can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project applies machine learning algorithms to a dataset of heart health indicators to classify patients as having heart disease or not.

The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization within a Jupyter notebook.

## Dataset

The dataset `heart.csv` contains various medical attributes, such as:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol level
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting electrocardiographic results
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression induced by exercise
- Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
- Thalassemia status
- Presence or absence of heart disease (target variable)

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations  
- Implementation of machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)  
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics  
- Interpretation of results and insights
